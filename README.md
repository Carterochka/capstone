# Welcome to complimentary repository for my capstone project!
## Comparative Analysis of Traditional Recurrent Neural Networks and Reservoir Computing Models for Predicting Complex Ball Trajectories in a 2D Environment

The structure of this repository is the following:
- `data` module contains the scripts for data generation. If, for some reasons, you are unable to run them, you can use this link to download the raw data from my Google Drive (about 1.2 GB). Just place the "raw" folder inside the "data" folder.
- `deliverables` contains my write-ups, including the paper I submitted for my capstone.
- `models` contains importable implementations of all the deep learning models that I was using in my research.
- `notebooks` contains all the notebooks that document my research process. Inside, there is a folder called "playground", which I used for initial experiments. Right now this folder is mostly used for garbage collection, with most notebooks needing slight modification in the relative file paths to be done to resurrect the notebooks inside. I decided to leave the experimental notebooks in this folder instead of deleting them as they were an important part of my neural networks exploration. Let them stay at least for the memory :) 
- `visuals` contains some drawings of initial machine learning models that I was playing with. This folder will be removed soon!
